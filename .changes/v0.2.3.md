## v0.2.3 - 2025-03-28

[compare changes](https://github.com/indaco/tempo/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3)

**No functional or API-level changes are introduced in this release.**

The main improvement in this release is a packaging optimization:

- The demo.gif file previously embedded in the main branch has been moved to a separate `gh-assets` branch.
- This change ensures that users installing the module no longer download the demo asset, resulting in reduced disk usage and faster installs.
